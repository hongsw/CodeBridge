Here's how you could do it using Flexbox:\n\n```web\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"card\">Content 1</div>\n  <div class=\"card\">Content 2</div>\n  <!-- More cards... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nAnd the CSS:\n\n```web\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: space-around; /* This will distribute items evenly in the container */\n}\n\n.card {\n  flex: 1 0 200px; /* This is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. It means that the card will grow as needed but not shrink below its base size of 200px */\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will create a row of cards that wrap to the next line when there is not enough space, and evenly distribute the remaining space between them. The `flex` property is a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` which determine how a flex item grows or shrinks to fit the container.\n",
