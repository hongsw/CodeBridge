  "rawResponse": "You can use Flexbox or Grid to make your web page more responsive. Here's how you could modify your CSS using Flexbox:\n\n```web\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n\n.card {\n  width: calc(100% / 3); /* Adjust this value for more/less cards per row */\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n```\nThis will make your .container a flex container, and each .card item will take up one third of the available space. The `flex-wrap` property ensures that if there isn't enough space to fit all the cards in one line, they wrap onto new lines. \n\nRemember, for this to work properly, you need to ensure your parent container has a defined width or max-width. If it doesn't have any of these properties set on it, then Flexbox will not function as expected. In the provided code, `.container` is already set to center its children by using `margin: 0 auto;`\n",
